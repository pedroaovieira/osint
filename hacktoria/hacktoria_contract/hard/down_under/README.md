# Hacktoria - Lost Down Under


# Hacktoria

Greetings Special Agent K. We need your assistance in an urgent matter. Our client, the Australian Secret Intelligence Agency, ASIS for short, has requested our help to uncover a terrorist organization.

This group, who’s name is yet to be uncovered, has shown intent on bombing several locations around Australia. Their origins are confirmed to be domestic, with money coming in from Chinese non-government actors.

Several hours ago, one of our Red Teams was able to breach one of the terrorist groups’ email accounts. There was a single email, containing a cryptic looking text and a total of seven images.

We need you to figure out what these seven images and text mean. Are they connected? Is this a rabbit hole? With our current information, we have reason to believe these images are directly related to the suspected plans for bombings.

The answer from the text and images leads to the password for unlocking the linkfile. Which contains the link to your contract card.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
