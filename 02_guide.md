### Face of the MP

- Run a facial recognition search with PimEyes (https://pimeyes.com/en) , if someone on the team does not have a paid account, just drop the photo on the Team discord channel and ask for a search.

### Main social Networks in the USA

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Tiktok
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Snapchat
- Reddit
- YouTube

    a.    1/If the MP is hiding on purpose, you may find information on the social accounts of friends or family, or you could find a hidden account of the MP using another name. 
    b.    Don’t forget to grab the Facebook ID and to submit it, this can help if the MP changes names on Facebook.
    c.    You can also pivot from the FB ID to see if the MP is selling stuff on FB Marketplace
    d.    A snapchat account can be found by adding the MP’s phone number to your contacts and then doing a contact search on your Snapchat account
    e.    LinkedIn, don’t forget to use both rocketreach and contactout to try and find the email of the MP and/or phone number
    f.    OSINTGram is good to gather information about an instagram account
    g.    Even if the instagram account is private, you can see underneath a few accounts connected to the MP, maybe by pivoting through them, this can reveal posts about the MP or photos, or comments
